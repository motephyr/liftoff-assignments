## Assignment Description
[Project Outline Assignment](https://education.launchcode.org/liftoff/modules/assignments/project-outline)

### Overview
I am so busy with so many things I don’t know how to transfer or sell the things I don’t need easily to people in need.

There is a page for selling items on https://craigslist.org/, but it still needs to describe in the text. I want to put the item on the shelf quickly without thinking about promoting it.

I hope to make the MVP of this platform based on ease of use, free from deception, and consideration of individual buyers and sellers.

Easy to use: You can publish your item by recording 10 seconds of video use mobile.
No deception: Use Fb to log in and ensure the authenticity of the product through face-to-face (or platform intermediary)
Privacy: Unless there are any problems with the transaction, we will not disclose personal identity.

PS: This is really a very simple and rough idea. Just let me know if you have any thoughts.

### Features

>Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application.

- **Add a new item with video:** 
>The seller can upload a video to introduce the product, then just add name and price

- **Edit User data and item state:** 
>The seller edits the contact method so that buyers who are willing to buy can contact.
>The seller can set the item editing status or whether it has been sold

- **Mobile-first(with capacitorjs):** 
>Let sellers use mobile phones to list products.
>And buyers use mobile phones to browse.

>We want sellers to upload only ten seconds of videos
